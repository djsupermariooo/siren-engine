Game Engine written in C++ using OpenGL

This project was ambitiously started as a way to dive deep into learning C++ with OpenGL. Unfortunately, I did not find the time to continue the project but I leave the code available for portfolio purposes.

The game engine has the functionality to import 3D models, texture them, view them (360 degree rotation), and control the models via keyboard/mouse and Xbox game controller. The ability to add a skybox is also implemented.
